## How to Run SOC Tools

To get started with the SOC Toolbelt, follow these steps to download and execute the scripts sequentially.

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator:**
   - Run PowerShell with elevated privileges to ensure all scripts execute properly.

2. **Download and Execute Scripts:**

   Copy and paste the following commands into your PowerShell window:

   ```powershell
   # Request temporary bypass of execution policy for the session
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force

   # Create a temporary directory
   $tempDir = New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "$env:TEMP\SOC-Toolbelt"

   # Download each script to the temporary directory
   $scripts = @(
       "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simon-im-security/SOC-Toolbelt/main/Network%20Connection%20Analysis.ps1",
       "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simon-im-security/SOC-Toolbelt/main/Windows%20Event%20Logs%20Analysis.ps1",
       "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simon-im-security/SOC-Toolbelt/main/User%20Login%20Analysis.ps1",
       "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simon-im-security/SOC-Toolbelt/main/Security%20Event%20Log%20Analysis.ps1",
       "https://github.com/simon-im-security/SOC-Toolbelt/blob/main/Process%20Checker%20Analysis.ps1"
   )

   foreach ($script in $scripts) {
       $currentScript++
       $scriptName = [System.IO.Path]::GetFileName($script)
       $scriptPath = "$tempDir\$scriptName"

       # Update the progress bar
       Write-Progress -Activity "Running SOC Toolbelt Scripts" -Status "Running $scriptName" -PercentComplete (($currentScript / $totalScripts) * 100)

       # Real-time status update
       Write-Output "Starting $scriptName at $(Get-Date)"
       
       try {
           Add-Content -Path $logFile -Value "Running $scriptName at $(Get-Date)"
           & $scriptPath -ErrorAction Stop -Verbose *>> $logFile
           Add-Content -Path $logFile -Value "$scriptName completed at $(Get-Date)"
           Write-Output "$scriptName completed at $(Get-Date)"
       } catch {
           $errorMsg = $_.Exception.Message
           $logEntry = "Error running ${scriptName}: ${errorMsg} at $(Get-Date)"
           Add-Content -Path $logFile -Value $logEntry
           Write-Output "Error encountered with $scriptName: $errorMsg"
           continue
       }
   }

   # Complete the progress bar
   Write-Progress -Activity "Running SOC Toolbelt Scripts" -Status "Completed" -PercentComplete 100 -Completed

   # Final real-time update
   Write-Output "All scripts completed at $(Get-Date)"
